The difference between change_rate.wav and change_samples.wav is that the pitch of change_rate.wav is higher than
the pitch of change_samples.wav .
By speeding up the file in change_samples.wav, we keep the same rate but remove the higher frequencies
and keep the remaining frequencies the same.
On the other side, in change_rate.wav we just speed up the samples.
