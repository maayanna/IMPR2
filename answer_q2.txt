The file audio produced by the phase vocoder was more similar to what I did expect the audio to
sound like than the audio produced by the function named resize_spectogram.
In the spectogram function I write, the audio was not so clear resulting by the phase not being very veru correct.
The phase correction done by the phase_vocoder function makes a clearer sound, mpre similar to the
original file.
