Using the conv_der and the fourier_der functions we get in fact two different magnitudes.
By calculating the derivative using fourier, we calculate it on all pixels it is a
continuous function.
And by calculating the derivative using convolution, we get an approximation of the values
(with the values that are around the point we want to derive)
-> Finally we get whiter pixels using the conv_der function ( higher intensity of the pixels
of the image).
